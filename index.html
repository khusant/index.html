        The fun continues with A Taste of Tulsa from Tulsa's best eateries, and the artistically inclined should plan on attending the Winter Art Fair on Tulsa's downtown square.

Music from Lester's Blues Band and The Jazz Express brings us into the New Year. The dancing starts at 7 p.m. and continues until midnight. From 10 to 11 p.m. we say goodbye to the old year (and ring in the new) with the famous New Year's Eve Bash fireworks spectacular.
